    <h1>Twinkle, twinkle little star</h1>
    <p>
        Twinkle, twinkle, little star, <br>
How I wonder what you are. <br>
Up above the world so high, <br>
Like a diamond in the sky. <br> <br>

When the blazing sun is gone, <br>
When he nothing shines upon, <br>
Then you show your little light, <br>
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night. <br><br>

Then the traveller in the dark, <br>
Thanks you for your tiny spark, <br>
He could not see which way to go, <br>
If you did not twinkle so. <br> <br>

In the dark blue sky you keep, <br>
And often through my curtains peep, <br>
For you never shut your eye, <br>
â€˜Till the sun is in the sky. <br><br>

As your bright and tiny spark, <br>
Lights the traveller in the dark. <br>
Though I know not what you are, <br>
Twinkle, twinkle, little star. <br>

Twinkle, twinkle, little star. <br>
How I wonder what you are. <br>
Up above the world so high, <br>
Like a diamond in the sky. <br><br>

Twinkle, twinkle, little star. <br>
How I wonder what you are. <br>
How I wonder what you are. <br><br>
